summary: >
  This doctoral thesis explores the use of algebraic methods in asymmetric cryptography, presenting new algorithms, cryptographic constructions, and structural cryptanalyses. It covers group-based cryptographic primitives, normal and k-normal elements in finite fields, and attacks on nonabelian protocols. The work unifies theoretical insights with practical relevance in cryptographic design and evaluation.
