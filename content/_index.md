Hello! My name is Simran, and I'm an IT Security Analyst with a background in applied mathematics and cryptography. I spend some of my free time learning core security concepts and trying to better understand the workings of systems, software, and the web. This website is a small space to gather notes and articles from my personal projects and study, and to document my existing research work. It brings together a few main threads:


### [Writeups](/writeups/)

A collection of notes structured notes, technical explanations of concepts, and code walkthroughs. Topics vary, but so far include (formatting of the posts is still immature and work in progress): 

- [Posts on concepts in cryptography](/writeups/#cryptography)  
- [Some notes from my studies on systems and security](/writeups/#systems-applications-security)  
- [Occasional notes on AI and machine learning](/writeups/#ai-and-machine-learning)  
- [Fragments of theoretical computer science](/writeups/#theoretical-computer-science)  
- [Two oldish pure mathematics posts](/writeups/#mathematics)  

### [Research](/research/)

A record of my academic work, including research in mathematical cryptography during my doctoral studies.


### [About](/about/)

A bit more about me and this website.
