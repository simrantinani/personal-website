Hello, and welcome to my website. I'm **Simran**. I currently work as an IT Security Analyst at cnlab security AG in Rapperswil, Switzerland. Before this job, I completed a PhD in Mathematics at the University of Zurich, where I worked in the field of applied algebra. My research focused on public-key cryptographic protocol constructions based on problems in algebra that are proposed for use as post-quantum one-way functions. 

The research was supported in part by the Cyber Defence Campus, which also gave me exposure to broader aspects of cybersecurity beyond my immediate research. ([Here's an _interview_](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/cyber-defence-fellowships-simran-tinani/) with them with a bit more about my research.)


Being trained as a mathematician and not a computer scientist, I try to make a conscious effort to build the foundations of knowledge I may have missed out on. Over the past year and a half, I am starting to appreciate how vast and layered the field of security actually is, and how much it rests on a thorough, deep understanding of systems, networks, applications, and more.


I built this site to document the things I learn and work on in my free time — concepts, explanations, code, etc. I find writing a useful way to understand, formalize, structure, and track theory and ideas. It also sometimes surfaces questions that may be otherwise missed.


### This website

I built this website using the static site generator Hugo, starting with the Texify3 theme for its LaTeX support, and gradually customizing the layout and styles. There were two reasons I wanted to build it myself. First, to have a single place to collect my writing, research, and ongoing projects, with the freedom to shape the layout without restrictions.

Second, since much of my work involves security testing web applications, I wanted a small, structured way to start exploring how they work under the hood. A static site is the simplest kind of web application, and this felt like a good place to start. At some point, I’d like to add more complexity  and perhaps even test the security of what I build. The site (content, structure, and styling) is still a work in progress.
