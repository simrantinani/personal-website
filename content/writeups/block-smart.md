In loose terms, a blockchain is a decentralized ledger that records information across a network of
computers and aims to preserve its accuracy and integrity without the appeal to a central authority.
On the other hand, a smart contract is a self-executing contract with machine-encoded terms of the
agreement. Smart contracts run on a blockchain network, utilizing its framework to execute and
record contractual actions without the need for a central authority. This paper is an exploration of
the functional and security aspects of blockchains, and more specifically, smart contracts. I wrote this as part of a project assigment.
